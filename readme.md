### Description

Improved version of the NXP's Sample Appl project for MPC574xG MCUs.

### Objectives

1) Adaptation for using with [DEVKIT-MPC5748G Rev.D](https://www.nxp.com/design/development-boards/automotive-development-platforms/mpc57xx-mcu-platforms/mpc5748g-development-board-for-secure-gateway:DEVKIT-MPC5748G).

2) Compliance with MCAL drivers TS_T2D35M10I5R0 (in the original state the MCAL project is configured for TS_T2D35M10I3R0).

3) Compliance with Os_TS_T2D35M4I0R92 (the original project reffers some prev revision).

3) Migration as a native S32 project (i.e. without using the original launch.bat).
